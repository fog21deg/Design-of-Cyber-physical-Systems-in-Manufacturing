**Resource:**

The Resource code defines the classes (paper, robot, operator, jig1,
jig2) and their methods for a simulation using SimPy. The summary of the
code structure:

1.  **Paper Class**:

    -   Represents a paper object that needs to be folded during the
        process

    -   Contains methods like **check_availability_pickup_station2** and
        **pick_paper** to simulate processes of paper handling.

2.  **Robot Class**:

    -   Represents a robot object.

    -   Contains methods like **actuate**, **load_paper**,
        **push_paper_to_jig1**, **insert_paper_to_jig2**,
        **extract_paper_from_jig2**, **hand_over_paper**, and
        **return_to_start** to simulate various robot actions during
        paper handling

3.  **Operator Class**:

    -   Represents an operator object.

    -   Contains methods like **eliminate_actuation_error**,
        **eliminate_paper_loading_error_robot**, **quality_check_jig1**,
        **eliminate_paper_loading_error_jig2**, **quality_check_jig2**,
        and **eliminate_hand_over_error** to simulate operator actions,
        quality checks, and error handling.

4.  **Jig1 Class**:

    -   Represents a jig1 object.

    -   Contains the **folding_process_1** method to simulate a process
        related to jig1.

5.  **Jig2 Class**:

    -   Represents a jig2 object.

    -   Contains methods like **check_paper_availability_jig2** and
        **folding_process_2** to simulate processes related to jig2.

**Environment:**

In the **Station3** class representing a station in a manufacturing
process. The station includes a robot, an operator, and various tools
like Jig1 and Jig2. The station is responsible for producing paper, and
the process logic for producing one paper is defined in the
**station3_process** method. Here\'s a breakdown of the process logic:

1.  **Initialization:**

    -   The station is initialized with components such as a robot, an
        operator, Jig1, Jig2, and a paper.

    -   Counters for produced papers and total production time are
        initialized.

2.  **Production Process (station3_process method):**

    -   The process begins by actuating the robot to check its starting
        position.

    -   The robot loads paper from Station 2, checks if the paper is
        loaded, and performs actions related to paper handling.

    -   The robot pushes the paper to Jig1 for a folding process.

    -   The operator checks the quality of the fold created by Jig1.

    -   The robot inserts the paper into Jig2 and performs additional
        actions.

    -   The robot extracts the paper from Jig2.

    -   The operator checks the quality of the second fold created by
        Jig2.

    -   The robot hands over the paper to Station 4.

    -   The robot returns to the start position.

3.  **Time Tracking:**

    -   The time for each step of the process is tracked.

    -   The total production time and the number of produced papers are
        updated.

4.  **Print Statements:**

    -   Print statements are included at each step to log the progress
        of the paper through the station.

The code defines the process logic for one paper production cycle at
Station 3. It utilizes SimPy for discrete-event simulation, allowing for
the modeling of timing considerations, random events, and the flow of
the manufacturing process.

**paper_generator** generator function that generates papers for the
simulation at different time intervals. Here\'s a breakdown of the code:

1.  **Generator Function (paper_generator):**

    -   The generator function is defined to run indefinitely (**while
        True**).

    -   It generates papers in a loop with a random inter-arrival time
        between 60 and 100 seconds.

    -   For each paper generated, a new **paper** object is created and
        added to the **paper_list**.

    -   The generator then yields a timeout event based on the
        inter-arrival time.

    -   The **station3_process** method of the **Station3** object is
        then initiated for the generated paper using
        **env.process(station3.station3_process(paper))**.

    -   Another timeout event is yielded to wait for the next paper
        generation.

    -   A print statement indicates the arrival of the next paper at the
        pickup area of Station 3.

2.  **TODO: Second Generator:**

    -   There is a placeholder comment for creating a second generator
        with a fixed number of papers. However, the actual code for this
        generator is not provided.

To complete the second generator, you could add code similar to the
first generator, but with a fixed number of iterations. For example:

def fixed_paper_generator(env, station3, paper_list, num_papers):

for \_ in range(num_papers):

paper_generator1 = paper(env, station3)

paper_list.append(paper_generator1)

yield env.process(station3.station3_process(paper))

print(f\"Paper {station3.produced_papers} arrived at station 3 pickup
area at {env.now} seconds.\")

This generator would generate a fixed number of papers specified by
**num_papers**.

**Simulation:**

It demonstrates the setup and execution of a simulation using SimPy.
Here\'s a breakdown of the code:

1.  **Create Environment and Station:**

    -   An instance of the SimPy environment (**env**) is created.

    -   An instance of the **Station3** class (**Station_instance**) is
        created with an empty list for paper tracking.

2.  **Run Simulation:**

    -   The **paper_generator** generator function is associated with
        the environment using **env.process(paper_generator(env,
        Station_instance, \[\]))**.

    -   The simulation is run for 28,800 seconds (8 hours or 1 shift)
        using **env.run(until=28800)**.

3.  **Print Simulation Results:**

    -   After the simulation is finished, results are printed.

    -   The total simulation time is printed using **print(\"The
        simulation runs for \" + str(env.now) + \" seconds.\")**.

    -   The number of produced papers is printed, keeping in mind that
        there is a paper in the process at the beginning of the
        simulation (**print(\"The number of produced papers is \" +
        str(Station_instance.produced_papers-1) + \".\")**).

    -   The average process time of the produced papers is printed
        (**print(\"The average process time of the produced papers is
        \" + str(Station_instance.total_production_time /
        (Station_instance.produced_papers-1)) + \" seconds.\")**).

Note: The simulation results are based on the implemented logic in the
**Station3** class and associated processes. The simulation considers
paper generation, processing, and quality checks within the specified
timeframe. Adjustments may be needed based on specific requirements or
refinements to the simulation logic.
